# LumenAI

A Claude-first plugin marketplace with a shared Agent Skills distribution by Bluminal Labs.

## What is this?

LumenAI is a structured registry of plugins and Agent Skills — collections of AI agents and commands that work together to accomplish complex software delivery tasks. Claude Code, Codex, and Grok install Synthex as a native plugin; Gemini CLI and OpenCode use the portable Agent Skills bundle.

Install the marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add bluminal/lumenai
```

Or install it in Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add bluminal/lumenai
codex plugin add synthex@lumenai
```

Or install it in Grok:

```bash
grok plugin marketplace add bluminal/lumenai
grok plugin install synthex --trust
```

Codex and Grok expose the same Synthex names as skills (for example, `$review-code` / `/synthex:review-code` and `$architect`). Gemini CLI and OpenCode consume that same generated Agent Skills layer through their workspace or project skill roots. Thin generated skill entrypoints load the existing files under `commands/` and `agents/`, so those Markdown definitions remain the single behavioral source of truth.

## Plugins

### Synthex

The first plugin in the marketplace. **Synthex** models a software startup's org chart as a collection of AI agents that synthesize to deliver complete, production-quality software.

```bash
/plugin install synthex
```

The organization spans the full software lifecycle: **discover, build, ship, operate, and learn** — with 31 agents organized into four layers and 20 commands that orchestrate them.

The tables below cover the core set. For the complete current roster, including the Haiku-backed utility agents and the multi-model, looping, and Notion-backend commands, see [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).

**Typical order when starting new work:** `init` → `write-prd` → `refine-requirements` → `write-implementation-plan` → `next-priority` → `review-code` → `retrospective`.

#### Agents (15)

**Orchestration Layer** — Lead roles that coordinate specialists and drive execution.

| Agent | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|
| **Tech Lead** | Full-stack orchestrator, primary coding agent | Execution + Orchestration |
| **Lead Frontend Engineer** | Frontend tech lead, delegates to framework specialists | Execution + Delegation |
| **Product Manager** | Requirements gathering, implementation planning, product strategy | Planning + Strategy |

**Specialist Layer** — Domain experts invoked by leads or commands for focused work.

| Agent | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|
| **Architect** | System architecture guidance, ADRs, plan feasibility review | Advisory + Planning |
| **Code Reviewer** | Craftsmanship review, specification compliance, convention adherence | Advisory (PASS/WARN/FAIL) |
| **Security Reviewer** | Security review quality gate (vulnerabilities, secrets, access control) | Advisory (PASS/WARN/FAIL) |
| **Terraform Plan Reviewer** | Infrastructure-as-code review (cost, risk, security) | Advisory (PASS/WARN/FAIL) |
| **Quality Engineer** | Test strategy, coverage analysis, test writing | Execution + Advisory |
| **Design System Agent** | Design tokens, component governance, compliance audits | Execution + Advisory |
| **Performance Engineer** | Full-stack performance analysis (Core Web Vitals, queries, bundles) | Advisory |
| **SRE Agent** | SLOs/SLIs, observability, runbooks, blameless postmortems | Advisory + Execution |
| **Technical Writer** | API docs, user guides, migration guides, changelogs | Execution |

**Research & Analysis Layer** — Agents focused on understanding users, measuring outcomes, and driving improvement.

| Agent | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|
| **UX Researcher** | Research plans, personas, journey maps, Opportunity Solution Trees | Planning + Advisory |
| **Metrics Analyst** | DORA metrics, HEART/AARRR frameworks, OKR tracking | Advisory |
| **Retrospective Facilitator** | Structured retrospectives, improvement item tracking | Planning + Advisory |

#### Commands (12)

| Command | Purpose | Agents Orchestrated |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **init** | Initialize project configuration and directories | -- |
| **write-prd** | Author a PRD from supplied sources plus an interview, with provenance on every requirement | PM + PRD Linter |
| **next-priority** | Execute next highest-priority tasks | Tech Lead |
| **refine-requirements** | Improve PRD clarity through multi-agent review | PM + Tech Lead + Lead Frontend Engineer |
| **write-implementation-plan** | Transform PRD into implementation plan | PM + Architect + Design System Agent + Tech Lead |
| **review-code** | Multi-perspective code review | Code Reviewer + Security Reviewer + Performance Engineer (opt.) |
| **write-adr** | Create Architecture Decision Record | Architect (interactive) |
| **write-rfc** | Create Request for Comments | Architect + PM + Tech Lead + Security Reviewer |
| **test-coverage-analysis** | Analyze test gaps, optionally write tests | Quality Engineer |
| **design-system-audit** | Audit frontend for design system compliance | Design System Agent |
| **retrospective** | Structured cycle retrospective | Metrics Analyst + Retrospective Facilitator |
| **reliability-review** | Operational readiness assessment | SRE Agent + Terraform Plan Reviewer (opt.) |
| **performance-audit** | Full-stack performance analysis | Performance Engineer |

### Synthex+ (Beta)

A **companion plugin** to Synthex that adds persistent team orchestration via Claude Code's beta Agent Teams API. Synthex+ reuses Synthex agent definitions — it does not duplicate or modify them.

> **BETA** — Requires the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` feature flag. Both the Agent Teams API and this plugin are under active development.

```bash
/plugin install synthex-plus
```

Where standard Synthex spawns ephemeral subagents (each unaware of the others), Synthex+ creates persistent teams where agents share a task list, exchange messages via mailboxes, and coordinate autonomously.

| Synthex Command | Synthex+ Equivalent | What Changes |
|----------------|--------------------|----|
| `next-priority` | `team-implement` | Persistent team with real-time coordination instead of sequential subagent invocations |
| `review-code` | `team-review` | Cross-domain messaging between reviewers (e.g., code reviewer alerts security reviewer) |
| `write-implementation-plan` | `team-plan` | Reviewers persist across review cycles, retaining full context |
| `refine-requirements` | `team-refine` | Persistent reviewers with cross-perspective messaging during PRD refinement |

#### Commands (5)

| Command | Purpose | Synthex Agents Used |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **team-init** | Initialize Synthex+ configuration | -- |
| **team-implement** | Sustained multi-agent implementation | Tech Lead + Frontend Engineer + Quality Engineer + Code Reviewer + Security Reviewer |
| **team-review** | Multi-perspective code review with cross-domain communication | Code Reviewer + Security Reviewer + Performance Engineer (opt.) + Design System Agent (opt.) |
| **team-plan** | Collaborative implementation planning with persistent reviewers | Product Manager + Architect + Design System Agent + Tech Lead |
| **team-refine** | Collaborative PRD refinement with persistent reviewers | Product Manager + Tech Lead + Lead Frontend Engineer |

**When to use Synthex+ over Synthex:** Multi-component work spanning 3+ files across 2+ system layers, large code reviews (500+ LOC), security-sensitive changes, planning for 10+ requirements, or refining large PRDs (20+ requirements). For quick, focused tasks, standard Synthex is lighter and more cost-effective.

See the [Synthex+ README](./plugins/synthex-plus/README.md) for full documentation.

## Multi-Model Review

Multi-model review fans review prompts out to multiple LLM-family proposers (OpenAI, Google, local-Ollama) via CLI adapters and consolidates findings into a single deduplicated, severity-reconciled, attributed list.

The primary benefit: catching correlated-error blind spots — bugs and issues that any single LLM family would miss but that show up when multiple families review independently.

**Off by default.** Opt in via `/synthex:init` (interactive prompt) or by editing `.synthex/config.yaml`. CLI-only — Synthex does not store API keys.

See [`docs/specs/multi-model-review/architecture.md`](docs/specs/multi-model-review/architecture.md) for the full design and [`docs/specs/multi-model-review/adapter-recipes.md`](docs/specs/multi-model-review/adapter-recipes.md) for per-adapter setup.

## Notion Backend

Synthex's documents — PRDs, implementation plans, ADRs, RFCs, runbooks, retrospectives — and its implementation-plan task state can live in Notion instead of local markdown, so product managers, designers, and stakeholders can read and track the work in the tool they already use.

The design commitment is **bolt-on compatibility**. Synthex points at databases you already have — your epics and the work items they break down into — and adapts to whatever properties they already carry. Because every Notion database row is itself a page, an initiative's requirements, plan, and retrospectives become subpages of its own epic row, and its work items relate back to it. One epic, one entry point.

Scoping runs on two dimensions so Synthex coexists with everyone else's work: each plan names its own epic, so concurrent initiatives never mix, and within an epic Synthex acts only on work **assigned to you or unassigned** — claiming an item when it starts so another engineer's run skips it. Work someone else holds is never read, modified, or reassigned. It never restructures a workspace and never changes a database schema without explicit consent.

**Off by default.** Opt in via `/synthex:configure-notion` (or the matching `/synthex:init` step). When disabled, behavior is byte-identical to pre-Notion Synthex. Access is through the Notion MCP server — Synthex holds no Notion API key and sends no source code.

You choose which document types go to Notion. The default split routes the epic-scoped three — requirements, plans, retrospectives — to Notion while leaving the cross-cutting four (specs, ADRs, RFCs, runbooks) in git, since `review-code` reads those on every invocation and they outlive any one initiative.

See [`docs/specs/notion-backend/setup.md`](docs/specs/notion-backend/setup.md) for setup and [`docs/specs/notion-backend/architecture.md`](docs/specs/notion-backend/architecture.md) for the design.

## Native Looping

Synthex 0.8+ ships a native `--loop` flag on iteration-friendly commands (`next-priority`, `write-implementation-plan`, `refine-requirements`, `review-code`, and all four Synthex+ team commands), plus a generic `/synthex:loop` for arbitrary prompts. Loops iterate in the same agent thread by default (auto-compaction handles the context window) and persist per-session state at `.synthex/loops/<loop-id>.json` for resume across sessions. See [`plugins/synthex/docs/native-looping.md`](plugins/synthex/docs/native-looping.md) for the full framework spec.

## Automated Testing

All agents are tested using a three-layer testing pyramid. Since agents are pure markdown (no runtime code), testing works by invoking agents with synthetic fixtures and validating their outputs.

| Layer | What | Cost | When |
|-------|------|------|------|
| 1 - Schema | Validates markdown structure, sections, tables, verdict format | $0 | Every PR |
| 2 - Behavioral | Regex/JS assertions against cached agent outputs | ~$3/run (cached) | Manual trigger |
| 3 - Semantic | LLM-as-judge evaluates accuracy and quality | ~$8/run | Manual trigger |

**Current coverage:** 404 tests across 18 test suites — 206 for Synthex agents + 131 for Synthex+ templates, hooks, and command outputs + 67 for shared infrastructure. See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for full details.

```bash
cd tests && npx vitest run schemas/   # Layer 1: instant, free
```
