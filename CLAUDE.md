# LumenAI — Developer Instructions

## Project Overview

This is **LumenAI** — a Claude Code plugin marketplace by Bluminal Labs. The first plugin is **Synthex**, a collection of AI agents modeled after a software startup org chart.

## How Plugins Work

- **Agents** are markdown files in `agents/` that define an AI role (identity, responsibilities, behavioral rules, output format)
- **Commands** are markdown files in `commands/` that define orchestration workflows (parameters, workflow steps, which agents to invoke)
- **plugin.json** registers agents and commands within a plugin. Claude Code reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Codex and Grok read their own manifests and load the generated `skills/` wrappers, which point back at those same files.
- **marketplace.json** registers plugins within the marketplace. Claude Code, Codex, and Grok each have their own marketplace file (`.claude-plugin/`, `.agents/plugins/`, `.grok-plugin/`).
- After adding or renaming a command or agent, regenerate the shared skill wrappers with `node plugins/synthex/scripts/generate-codex-skills.mjs`. Do not hand-edit `skills/*/SKILL.md`.

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create a new `.md` file in `plugins/[plugin-name]/agents/`
2. Define the agent's role, responsibilities, workflow, output format, and behavioral rules
3. Add the agent name to the `agents` array in `plugins/[plugin-name]/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

## Adding a New Command

1. Create a new `.md` file in `plugins/[plugin-name]/commands/`
2. Define parameters, workflow steps, and which agents to invoke
3. Add the command filename to the `commands` array in `plugins/[plugin-name]/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

## Adding a New Plugin

1. Create a new directory under `plugins/`
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with agent and command registrations
3. Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

## Releasing

Releases are **automated** by `.github/workflows/release.yml` on every merge to `main`. Do **not** hand-edit marketplace versions, `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/synthex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/synthex/.grok-plugin/plugin.json` versions, or `CHANGELOG.md` in feature PRs — the workflow owns all of those.

How it works:

1. The workflow runs Layer 1 schema tests as the gate.
2. It walks commits since the previous `v*` tag and picks a semver bump from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer or `<type>!:` subject → **major**
   - `feat:` → **minor**
   - `fix:` / `perf:` / `refactor:` / `revert:` / `build:` / `ci:` / `chore:` / `docs:` / `style:` / `test:` → **patch**
   - No Conventional Commits since the last tag → **no release** (skipped silently)
3. Both plugins and the marketplace top-level version are lockstep-bumped, a CHANGELOG entry is generated from the same commit range, the release commit is tagged `v<marketplace-version>`, and a GitHub release is published.
4. After the GitHub release is created, a Claude Code agent step opens a **draft pull request** in `bluminal/slashsynthex.com` with proposed docs updates (release notes entry, command/agent reference updates, version bumps). The step is best-effort (`continue-on-error: true`) and never blocks the release. It runs only when all three required secrets are present (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DOCS_PR_APP_ID`, `DOCS_PR_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`); otherwise it is skipped silently.

### Required secrets

Configure on `bluminal/lumenai` for the cross-repo docs-PR step to run:

| Secret | Source | Scope |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | console.anthropic.com | Pay-per-use; per release runs roughly $1–3 at the 30-turn cap |
| `DOCS_PR_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID | App must be installed on both `bluminal/lumenai` and `bluminal/slashsynthex.com` |
| `DOCS_PR_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | GitHub App private key (PEM) | Permissions: contents:write, pull-requests:write on `slashsynthex.com` only |

The agent always opens a **draft** PR — a human reviews and merges. If the agent can't find a sensible docs home for a code change, it flags it in the PR body under "Could not auto-document" rather than fabricating.

Implications for contributors:

- Use Conventional Commit subjects on every commit that lands on `main` (the `commit-message-author` agent does this by default).
- Mark breaking changes with `<type>!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer — getting this wrong means a major change ships as a minor.
- The bot pushes the release commit and tag using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which by GitHub policy does not re-trigger workflows, so there's no release loop.

## Conventions

- Agent filenames: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `tech-lead.md`, `security-reviewer.md`)
- Command filenames: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `next-priority.md`)
- Commands can be nested in subdirectories (e.g., `commands/testing/fix-tests.md`)
- All agent and command definitions are markdown — no runtime code
- PRDs go in `docs/reqs/`, implementation plans go in `docs/plans/`
- NEVER place implementation plans or progress tracking in this file (CLAUDE.md)

| `notion-task-store` | Haiku-backed; implements the task operations against an existing Notion database. Enforces workstream scoping (FR-NB4) and property mapping with graceful degradation (FR-NB5) | Utility |

## Commands

| Command | Purpose | Agents Orchestrated |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `init` | Initialize project configuration and directories. During first-run, delegates the "Configure Multi-Model Review (optional)" sub-step to `/synthex:configure-multi-model` per FR-UO3, and the "Configure Notion Backend (optional)" sub-step to `/synthex:configure-notion` per FR-NB6. Neither sub-step can abort `init`. | — |
| `configure-multi-model` | Re-runnable wizard for the `multi_model_review` config block. Detects installed CLIs, runs auth checks, surfaces 3 options (Enable with detected / Enable later / Skip), and shows FR-MR27 data-transmission warning. Idempotent — re-entering when already enabled offers Re-run / Reset to disabled / Leave as-is. | — |
| `configure-notion` | Re-runnable wizard for the `documents.backend*` and `notion` config blocks. Points Synthex at an **existing** Notion page and task database, discovers the database's real schema, maps properties, sets the workstream identifier, and shows the FR-NB8 data-transmission warning. Idempotent — re-entering when enabled offers Re-run / Reset to disabled / Leave as-is. Refuses to configure tasks unscoped. | — |
| `dismiss-upgrade-nudge` | Silence the SessionStart upgrade nudge for this project by writing `dismissed: true` to `.synthex/state.json`. Idempotent; no arguments. | — |
| `loop` | Generic native-looping primitive. Loops an arbitrary prompt (literal `--prompt` or `--prompt-file <path>`) until the completion promise is emitted or `--max-iterations` is reached. Per-session state at `.synthex/loops/<loop-id>.json`; supports `--resume <id>` / `--resume-last`. | — |
| `list-loops` | Enumerate running and recent terminal-status loops in `.synthex/loops/`. Read-only. Output format: `RUNNING (N)` + `COMPLETED (M)` blocks sorted by recency. | — |
| `cancel-loop` | Cancel a loop by id, or `--all` running loops in the project. Mutates state-file `status: "cancelled"` atomically; idempotent on terminal-status loops. Polled at the looping command's iteration boundary (worst-case latency: one iteration). | — |
| `next-priority` | Execute next highest-priority tasks. Supports `--loop` for native iteration until every task is `done` (or milestone-boundary exit). Supports `--auto-decide` so the Tech Lead resolves discretionary escalations with its own recommendation instead of asking, recording the decision and alternatives for later review; `[H]` acceptance-criteria approval is always exempt. | Tech Lead |
| `refine-requirements` | Improve PRD clarity through multi-agent review | PM + Tech Lead + Lead Frontend Engineer |
| `write-implementation-plan` | Transform PRD into implementation plan. Supports multi-model plan-review via the orchestrator (FR-MR22); no complexity gate applied. Use `--multi-model` / `--no-multi-model` to override config. | PM + Architect + design-system-agent + Tech Lead |
| `review-code` | Multi-perspective code review. Supports multi-model review via FR-MR21 8-step decision framework + complexity gate (FR-MR21a). Use `--multi-model` / `--no-multi-model` to override config. When multi-model is active, fans out to native + external proposers via the orchestrator. | Code Reviewer + Security Reviewer + Performance Engineer (opt.) |
| `write-adr` | Create Architecture Decision Record | Architect (interactive) |
| `write-rfc` | Create Request for Comments | Architect + PM + Tech Lead + Security Reviewer |
| `test-coverage-analysis` | Analyze test gaps, optionally write tests | Quality Engineer |
| `design-system-audit` | Audit frontend for design system compliance | design-system-agent |
| `retrospective` | Structured cycle retrospective | Metrics Analyst + Retrospective Facilitator |
| `reliability-review` | Operational readiness assessment | SRE Agent + Terraform Plan Reviewer (opt.) |
| `performance-audit` | Full-stack performance analysis | Performance Engineer |

See `docs/agent-interactions.md` for the complete interaction map and `docs/research-sources.md` for the research behind each agent's design.

### Pool Routing (standing review pools)

When a standing review pool is running (started via synthex-plus), `/review-code` and `/performance-audit` automatically route to it instead of invoking the default single-model reviewer sequence. Pool routing requires `standing_pools.enabled: true` in `.synthex-plus/config.yaml`. See `docs/specs/multi-model-teams/` for full pool specifications (architecture, lifecycle, routing rules, and recovery).

## Commands (Synthex Plus)

Synthex Plus extends Synthex with multi-model team orchestration, standing reviewer pools, and parallel execution workflows.

| Command | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `start-review-team` | Start a standing review pool | Launches persistent pool of reviewer agents; pool ID returned for routing |
| `stop-review-team` | Stop a standing review pool | Gracefully drains in-flight reviews and tears down the pool |
| `list-teams` | List running pools | Shows active pool IDs, reviewer composition, and current load |
| `team-review` | Multi-model team code review | Fan-out review to all pool members; consolidates findings |
| `team-implement` | Parallel task implementation | Distributes implementation tasks across a team |
| `team-plan` | Collaborative implementation planning | Multi-model plan review and refinement |
| `team-refine` | Team-based requirements refinement | Fan-out PRD review across agents |
| `team-init` | Initialize a multi-model team project | Sets up `.synthex-plus/config.yaml` and pool configuration |
| `configure-teams` | Re-runnable wizard for the `standing_pools` config block. Surfaces enable/skip + routing_mode + matching_mode questions. Does NOT spawn a pool (FR-MMT27 #3). Idempotent. | — |
| `dismiss-upgrade-nudge` | Silence the synthex-plus SessionStart upgrade nudge for this project by writing `dismissed: true` to `.synthex-plus/state.json`. Idempotent; no arguments. | — |

See `docs/specs/multi-model-teams/` for pool specifications.

## Notion Backend

Synthex's documents and implementation-plan task state can be routed into an **existing** Notion workspace instead of local markdown. Off by default (`notion.enabled: false`); when disabled, behavior is byte-identical to pre-Notion Synthex (FR-NB2).

The design commitment is bolt-on compatibility: Synthex roots documents under a page you nominate, writes task rows into a database you nominate, maps onto that database's existing properties, and scopes every row it touches to a workstream identifier so it coexists with other teams' work. It never restructures a workspace and never changes a database schema without explicit consent. Access is via the Notion MCP server — Synthex holds no Notion API key.

Run `/synthex:configure-notion` to set it up. See [`docs/specs/notion-backend/setup.md`](docs/specs/notion-backend/setup.md) for the setup guide, [`docs/specs/notion-backend/architecture.md`](docs/specs/notion-backend/architecture.md) for the design, and [`plugins/synthex/agents/_shared/document-store-contract.md`](plugins/synthex/agents/_shared/document-store-contract.md) for the normative contract.

## Project Configuration Framework

Synthex uses a **convention over configuration** approach for project-level customization.

### How It Works

- **Without a config file:** Commands and agents use sensible embedded defaults. Everything works out of the box.
- **With a config file:** Projects override specific settings in `.synthex/config.yaml`. Only include what you want to change.
- **Config lives in the repo:** Version-controlled alongside code, so the team shares the same configuration.

### Initialization

Run the `init` command to create the configuration file and document directories:
```
/init
```

This creates:
- `.synthex/config.yaml` — Project configuration (copied from `plugins/synthex/config/defaults.yaml`)
- `docs/reqs/` — Product requirements directory
- `docs/plans/` — Implementation plans directory
- `docs/specs/` — Technical specifications directory
- `docs/specs/decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- `docs/specs/rfcs/` — Requests for Comments (RFCs)
- `docs/runbooks/` — Operational runbooks
- `docs/retros/` — Retrospective documents

### What's Configurable

See `plugins/synthex/config/defaults.yaml` for the full reference. Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `review_loops.max_cycles` | 2 | Global max review loop iterations for all commands |
| `review_loops.min_severity_to_address` | high | Global minimum severity that must be resolved |
| `refine_requirements.reviewers` | product-manager, tech-lead, design-system-agent | Sub-agents that review PRD for clarity |
| `implementation_plan.reviewers` | architect, design-system-agent, tech-lead | Sub-agents that review draft implementation plans |
| `implementation_plan.concurrent_tasks` | 3 | Max parallelizable tasks per milestone in the plan |
| `implementation_plan.review_loops.max_cycles` | 3 | Per-command override (higher for high-stakes plans) |
| `code_review.reviewers` | code-reviewer, security-reviewer | Reviewers for `review-code` command |
| `code_review.max_diff_lines` | 300 | Warn when diff exceeds this size |
| `code_review.spec_paths` | `[docs/specs]` | Specifications for compliance checking |
| `quality.coverage_thresholds` | line: 80, branch: 70, function: 80 | Coverage thresholds |
| `quality.test_runner` | vitest | Test runner for coverage reports |
| `architecture.decisions_path` | `docs/specs/decisions` | ADR storage |
| `architecture.rfcs_path` | `docs/specs/rfcs` | RFC storage |
| `design_system.spec_path` | `docs/specs/design-system.md` | Design system spec |
| `design_system.scan_paths` | `[src/]` | Paths to audit for compliance |
| `reliability.slo_document` | `docs/specs/slos.md` | SLO/SLI definitions |
| `reliability.runbooks_path` | `docs/runbooks` | Operational runbooks |
| `retrospective.format` | start-stop-continue | Retrospective format |
| `retrospective.max_improvement_items` | 3 | Max items per cycle |
| `next_priority.concurrent_tasks` | `3` | Max parallel tasks for `next-priority` command |
| `worktrees.base_path` | `.claude/worktrees` | Base directory for parallel execution worktrees |
| `worktrees.branch_prefix` | `feature/` | Branch name prefix for worktree branches |
| `documents.requirements` | `docs/reqs/main.md` | Default PRD path |

| `documents.backend_overrides` | `{}` | Per-document-type backend override map. Resolution: override > global > `filesystem` |
| `notion.enabled` | `false` | Master switch for the Notion backend. When false, behavior is byte-identical to pre-Notion Synthex (FR-NB2) |
| `notion.strict_mode` | `false` | `false` falls back to filesystem on error; `true` aborts |
| `notion.docs_root` | `null` | Existing Notion page to create document pages under |
| `notion.tasks_database` | `null` | Existing Notion database to write task rows into |
| `notion.workstream` | `{property: null, value: null}` | Scopes every row Synthex reads or writes. Required for tasks — Synthex refuses to run unscoped |
| `notion.property_map` | `{}` | Canonical task field → the target database's property name |
| `notion.status_values` | `{}` | Canonical task state → the target database's option name |

### Design Pattern

This configuration framework is designed to be extended. As new commands and agents are added, their configurable settings are added to `config/defaults.yaml` with sensible defaults. Projects only override what they need to change.

## Automated Testing Framework

The agents and commands are tested using a three-layer testing pyramid. Since agents are pure markdown (no runtime code), testing works by invoking agents with synthetic fixtures and validating their outputs.

### Testing Pyramid

```
         /\            Layer 3: SEMANTIC EVAL
        /  \           (Manual trigger — LLM-as-judge)
       /    \
      /------\         Layer 2: BEHAVIORAL ASSERTIONS
     / cached  \       (Manual trigger — one LLM call, many assertions)
    /  outputs  \
   /------------\      Layer 1: SCHEMA VALIDATION
  / zero LLM cost \   (Every PR — golden snapshots)
 /________________\
```

| Layer | What | Cost | When |
|-------|------|------|------|
| 1 - Schema | Validates markdown structure, sections, tables, verdict format | $0 | Every PR |
| 2 - Behavioral | Regex/JS assertions against cached agent outputs | ~$3/run (cached) | Manual trigger |
| 3 - Semantic | LLM-as-judge evaluates accuracy and quality | ~$8/run | Manual trigger |

### Schema Validator Coverage

Every testable agent has a schema validator and a corresponding test suite with inline sample outputs:

| Agent | Validator | Tests | Fixtures | Key Validations |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| terraform-reviewer | `terraform-reviewer.ts` | 46 | 8 | Resource changes, cost analysis, destructive actions, security |
| security-reviewer | `security-reviewer.ts` | 33 | 7 | CWE references, severity sorting, verdict consistency |

> The per-agent counts in the table above cover the original 13 schema validators only. The suite has grown well beyond them (multi-model review, multi-model teams, native looping, upgrade onboarding, cross-harness compatibility, and the Notion backend all add their own suites). Treat "no regressions against the pre-change run" as the bar rather than a fixed number, and re-measure with `npx vitest run schemas/` rather than trusting this line.

### Running Tests

```bash
cd tests

# Layer 1: Schema validation (instant, free)
npx vitest run schemas/

# Layer 2: Behavioral assertions (uses cached LLM outputs)
npx promptfoo eval --config promptfoo.config.yaml --filter-pattern "B[0-9]"

# Layer 3: Semantic evaluation (LLM-as-judge)
npx promptfoo eval --config promptfoo.config.yaml --filter-pattern "S[0-9]"

# All layers
npm run test:all
```

### Caching Strategy

LLM outputs are cached by `hash(agent.md + fixture + model)`. Changing an agent definition or fixture invalidates the cache and triggers a fresh LLM call. Unchanged agents reuse cached outputs at zero cost.

### Adding Tests for a New Agent

1. Create fixtures in `tests/fixtures/{agent-name}/`
2. Add a schema validator in `tests/schemas/{agent-name}.ts`
3. Add Vitest tests in `tests/schemas/{agent-name}.test.ts`
4. Add behavioral assertions to `tests/promptfoo.config.yaml`
5. Generate golden snapshots: `npm run snapshots:update`
