# Write Implementation Plan

Transform a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into a prioritized, value-driven implementation plan optimized for parallel execution and incremental delivery — refined through multi-agent peer review.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `requirements_path` | Path to the PRD markdown file | `docs/reqs/main.md` | No |
| `plan_path` | Path where the implementation plan will be written | `docs/plans/main.md` | No |
| `specs_path` | Path to technical specifications directory | `docs/specs` | No |
| `config_path` | Path to synthex project config | `.synthex/config.yaml` | No |
| `concurrent_tasks` | Max tasks to recommend for parallel execution per milestone | `3` (from config) | No |
| `--loop` | Enable native looping (FR-NL1/FR-NL2). When set, the command iterates per the "Native Looping" section below until the completion promise is emitted or `--max-iterations` is reached. | off | No |
| `--completion-promise <string>` | Promise text the agent emits as `<promise>X</promise>` to terminate the loop. | — | Required with `--loop` (unless `--resume*`) |
| `--max-iterations <int>` | Iteration cap (FR-NL13). Hard ceiling 200. | `20` | No |
| `--loop-isolated` | Fresh-subagent isolation mode per iteration (FR-NL18). | off (shared-context default) | No |
| `--name <slug>` | User-supplied loop-id slug `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`. | auto: `<command-slug>-<4-char-hex>` | No |

## Core Responsibilities

You orchestrate the creation of a high-quality implementation plan through:
1. Invoking the **Product Manager sub-agent** to gather requirements and draft the plan
2. Running a cheap **structural audit** via the Plan Linter sub-agent (Haiku) to catch template violations before invoking expensive reviewers
3. Running a **peer review loop** where specialist sub-agents provide structured feedback, with findings deduplicated and grouped by the Findings Consolidator sub-agent (Haiku) before the PM consumes them
4. Iterating until the plan is clear, complete, and compact enough for efficient agent consumption

---

## Acceptance Criteria Types

Every task in the implementation plan must have acceptance criteria. Each criterion is tagged with one of three types that determine how it is validated during execution:

| Type | Tag | Validation | Scope |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Testable** | `[T]` | Proven by an automated test (unit, integration, e2e). The test must exist and pass before the task is marked complete. The test file and test name are linked back to the criterion in the plan upon completion. | Task-level |
| **Human-validated** | `[H]` | Requires human-in-the-loop approval — the user is interviewed and confirms the criterion is met before the task is merged. Used for design decisions, stakeholder sign-off, UX judgment calls. | Task-level |
| **Observational** | `[O]` | Requires deployment and elapsed time to measure (e.g., user adoption rates, error rate reduction, performance trends). Cannot be validated at task completion time. | Phase or Milestone-level |

### Guidance for the Product Manager

- **Prefer `[T]` criteria.** Every task should have at least one testable criterion whenever the task produces functional behavior. If a task's acceptance criteria are all `[H]` or `[O]`, question whether the task is well-scoped.
- **`[O]` criteria belong at the milestone or phase level**, not individual tasks. They represent outcomes that emerge from the combined work of multiple tasks and can only be measured after deployment. List them under the milestone's **Observational Outcomes** line.
- **`[H]` criteria create scheduling constraints.** Tasks with `[H]` criteria require a user interview before merge, which means they cannot complete autonomously. When identifying parallelizable work, note that `[H]` tasks will pause for user input — schedule them early in a batch so the user review can happen while other tasks continue executing.
- **Be specific.** `[T] Login form validates email format` is actionable. `[T] Works correctly` is not.

## Document Backend

This command a PRD and writes an implementation plan. When the Notion backend is enabled for those document types, resolve them through the document-store contract rather than reading the path parameters directly. The mechanical framework — backend resolution order, delegation to `notion-document-store` and `notion-task-store`, response handling, and the strict-mode vs. fail-soft degradation policy — lives once in [`plugins/synthex/docs/document-backends.md`](../docs/document-backends.md). Only the command-specific bits are inlined below.

**Document types touched:** `requirements` (read), `specs` (read), `implementation_plan` (write)

**When `notion.enabled` is `false` — the default — skip this section entirely** and resolve `requirements_path`, `specs_path`, `plan_path` directly against the filesystem exactly as the Workflow below describes. The disabled path must stay byte-identical to pre-Notion behavior (FR-NB2), and the surest way to guarantee that is to run no new logic at all.

**Command-specific notes**

- Under the `notion` backend the finished plan is written as two things, not one: the prose sections (Overview, Decisions, Open Questions, milestone summaries) go to the plan overview page via `notion-document-store`, and each task becomes a row in the task database via `notion-task-store`. Step 7 below writes both.
- Create task rows with the canonical status `pending`. The adapter translates that to whatever the target database calls it.
- When the task database has no property mapped for `complexity`, `milestone`, or `dependencies`, the adapter reports a degradation and that data belongs in the overview page instead. Keep it in the plan prose rather than inventing a property for it.
- The `plan-linter` structural audit in Step 5.5 runs against the **draft markdown**, before any backend write. It is unaffected by this section.

## Workflow

### 1. Load Configuration

Check for a project configuration file at `@{config_path}`. If it exists, load the reviewer configuration and merge with defaults for any unspecified values. If it does not exist, load the defaults from the plugin's `config/defaults.yaml` file (located relative to this command at `../config/defaults.yaml`).

**How configuration works:**

1. The plugin ships a complete default configuration at `config/defaults.yaml`
2. Projects can override any setting by creating `.synthex/config.yaml` in their repo root (use the `init` command to scaffold this file)
3. Only settings present in the project config override the defaults — unspecified values fall through to `config/defaults.yaml`

**Default values** (from `config/defaults.yaml`):

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Reviewers | architect, designer, tech-lead (all enabled) |
| `review_loops.max_cycles` | 3 (per-command override; global default is 2) |
| `review_loops.min_severity_to_address` | high (inherited from global) |
| `documents.requirements` | `docs/reqs/main.md` |
| `documents.implementation_plan` | `docs/plans/main.md` |
| `documents.specs` | `docs/specs` |
| `concurrent_tasks` | 3 (max parallelizable tasks per milestone) |

**Review loop config resolution order:** `implementation_plan.review_loops` > global `review_loops` > hardcoded default (max_cycles: 2, min_severity_to_address: high).

Projects can customize by running `init` to create `.synthex/config.yaml`, then editing it. They can add reviewers (e.g., a security reviewer, compliance reviewer), disable defaults that aren't relevant, adjust max review cycles, or change the minimum severity threshold. See the Project Configuration section below for full details.

### Invocation Flags (FR-MR6)

The command accepts two mutually exclusive flags:
- `--multi-model` — force multi-model plan review regardless of config
- `--no-multi-model` — force native-only plan review regardless of config

Flag value overrides BOTH the master `multi_model_review.enabled` config AND the per-command `multi_model_review.per_command.write_implementation_plan.enabled` config.

When neither flag is set, the resolved config determines the path. **No complexity gate is consulted (FR-MR22)** — when multi-model is enabled (by config or flag), the orchestrator runs.

> **Contrast with `review-code`:** `review-code` has a complexity gate (FR-MR21a) that can skip multi-model for trivial diffs. `write-implementation-plan` has NO complexity gate — plans are always substantive enough to warrant full multi-model review when enabled. This distinction is explicit per FR-MR22.

### 2. Read and Understand Requirements

Read the PRD at `@{requirements_path}` thoroughly. Understand:
- The product vision and purpose
- Target users and their needs
- All functional and non-functional requirements
- What is explicitly out of scope
- Success metrics

### 3. Gather Technical Context

Read available technical specifications and project context:
- Check `@{specs_path}` for existing technical specs (architecture, frontend, design system)
- Check `@CLAUDE.md` for project conventions, patterns, and constraints
- Check `package.json` or equivalent for current tech stack
- Understand the current state of the codebase (what already exists)

### 4. User Interview

Launch the **Product Manager sub-agent** to conduct an interactive Q&A with the user. The PM uses the `AskUserQuestion` tool to surface questions directly to the human user. The PM should:
- Clarify any ambiguous or incomplete requirements from the PRD
- Confirm priorities and scope boundaries
- Understand constraints not captured in the PRD
- Fill gaps before drafting the plan

The PM asks questions in small batches (3-5 at a time) using `AskUserQuestion`, adapting follow-ups based on answers. This ensures the plan is grounded in a thorough understanding of the user's intent.

**Important:** The PM must use `AskUserQuestion` (not plain text output) so that questions reach the human user even when the PM is running as a sub-agent.

### 5. Draft the Implementation Plan

The Product Manager produces an initial implementation plan draft following the standard template (see Output section below). The draft must include:
- Phased milestones delivering incremental value
- Specific, executable tasks with complexity grades (S/M/L)
- Typed acceptance criteria for every task — each criterion tagged `[T]`, `[H]`, or `[O]` per the Acceptance Criteria Types section above
- Dependencies and critical path identified
- Parallelizable work explicitly called out (limit to `@{concurrent_tasks}` concurrent tasks per milestone, per config), with scheduling notes when a batch includes `[H]`-criteria tasks (start them early so user review overlaps with autonomous work)
- A **Decisions** section documenting major planning decisions and rationale
- An **Open Questions** section tracking items needing further discovery

### 5.5. Structural Lint Pass

Before sending the draft to expensive peer reviewers, run a fast structural audit with the **Plan Linter** sub-agent (Haiku-backed). This catches template violations, missing typed acceptance criteria, malformed task tables, and broken dependency references cheaply -- so the expensive reviewers (Architect, Tech Lead, Design System Agent) can spend their tokens on substantive concerns instead of structural nits.

**Process:**

1. Invoke the **plan-linter** sub-agent with the draft plan.
2. Plan Linter returns a structured report of structural findings, each tagged CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM.
3. Hand the linter report back to the Product Manager.
4. PM addresses all CRITICAL and HIGH findings from the linter. MEDIUM findings are addressed at PM's discretion.
5. Proceed to Step 6 with the linter-clean draft.

Plan Linter runs exactly once per draft cycle. It is not re-invoked between review cycles -- by that point the structural issues are resolved and further linting adds no value.

> **plan-linter (pre-review structural check) is UNAFFECTED by multi-model.** The plan-linter runs BEFORE the orchestrator (or before the native-only review path) — its sole job is structural validation of the draft plan markdown (sections present, well-formed tables, etc.). It does not consume reviewer findings and is not part of the orchestrator's reviewer set.

### 6. Peer Review Loop

This is the core quality mechanism. The draft plan is reviewed by specialist sub-agents who provide structured feedback.

**Process:**

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Draft Plan      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐     Haiku-backed structural audit
│  Plan Linter     │──── Runs ONCE per draft (Step 5.5)
│  (pre-review)    │     PM addresses structural findings
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐     Spawn FRESH reviewers IN PARALLEL

         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐

└────────┬────────┘

┌─────────────────┐

└─────────────────┘
```

**Step 6a: Resolve Multi-Model Branch**

Determine whether multi-model plan review is active for this invocation:

1. Check for `--multi-model` / `--no-multi-model` flags (see "### Invocation Flags (FR-MR6)" above). Flag value overrides config.
2. If no flag is set, read `multi_model_review.enabled` and `multi_model_review.per_command.write_implementation_plan.enabled` from the resolved config.
3. **No complexity gate is consulted (FR-MR22).** Unlike `review-code`, there is no "trivial plan" path — when multi-model is enabled (by config or flag), the orchestrator ALWAYS runs for plan review.

<!-- native-only path: today's write-implementation-plan native reviewer logic byte-identical to baseline (FR-MR23) -->

**Multi-model active → invoke orchestrator:**

When multi-model is active, invoke the `multi-model-review-orchestrator` agent with:
- `command: "write-implementation-plan"`
- `artifact_path` = the current draft plan path
- `native_reviewers: ["architect", "design-system-agent", "tech-lead"]` (the three native plan reviewers)
- `config` = the resolved `multi_model_review` block (from `.synthex/config.yaml` merged onto `defaults.yaml`)
- `per_reviewer_timeout_seconds` = from `multi_model_review.per_reviewer_timeout_seconds` config (default 180)

The orchestrator fans out to the three native reviewers AND all configured external adapters in a single parallel Task batch (FR-MR12), runs the full consolidation pipeline (Stages 1, 2, 4, 5, 5b, 6), and returns a unified consolidated envelope with `findings[]` attributed by reviewer.

Receive the unified consolidated envelope and pass its consolidated findings list directly to the Product Manager (Step 6d). The PM receives a single consolidated findings list with attribution — it does NOT process raw per-reviewer outputs.

**Native-only active → spawn native reviewers directly:**

When multi-model is NOT active (`multi_model_review.enabled: false` AND no `--multi-model` flag, OR `--no-multi-model` flag is set): run today's native-only path byte-identically (FR-MR23). For each enabled reviewer in the configuration, launch a **fresh** sub-agent IN PARALLEL with:
- The full draft implementation plan (current version)
- The PRD for reference
- The reviewer's specific focus area
- Instructions to provide structured feedback
- On cycles 2+: a compact summary of unresolved findings from the prior cycle (see Context Management below)

**Context Management:** Each review cycle spawns **new** sub-agent instances — never resume prior reviewer agents. This prevents context exhaustion across multiple cycles. Between cycles, the orchestrating command carries forward only:
1. The updated plan (full text — this is the artifact under review)
2. A compact findings summary: for each unresolved finding, one line with severity, title, and which reviewer raised it
3. The current cycle number

Do NOT carry forward full reviewer outputs, the PM's resolution notes from prior cycles, or the raw feedback history. The fresh reviewers will independently evaluate the current plan state.

**Step 6b: Reviewer Feedback Format**

Each reviewer must produce feedback in this structure:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan Review — [Reviewer Role]

### Findings

#### [CRITICAL] Finding Title
- **Section:** [Which part of the plan this affects]
- **Issue:** [What's wrong or missing]
- **Suggestion:** [Specific recommendation for improvement]

#### [HIGH] Finding Title
- **Section:** ...
- **Issue:** ...
- **Suggestion:** ...

#### [MEDIUM] Finding Title
...

#### [LOW] Finding Title
...

### Summary
[Overall assessment: Is the plan ready? What are the top concerns?]
```

**Severity definitions for plan review:**
- **CRITICAL** — Plan cannot be executed as-is. Missing critical tasks, fundamentally wrong sequencing, architectural impossibility, missing entire domain of work.
- **HIGH** — Significant quality issues. Vague acceptance criteria that will cause rework, missing dependencies, parallelization errors, unclear task scope that will block engineers.
- **MEDIUM** — Improvement opportunities. Could be clearer, minor dependency concerns, optimization suggestions, nice-to-have tasks missing.
- **LOW** — Polish. Formatting, naming, minor wording improvements.

**Step 6c: Consolidate Findings**

**Multi-model path:** The `multi-model-review-orchestrator` has already run the full consolidation pipeline (Stages 1–6) internally. The unified consolidated envelope returned in Step 6a contains the final `findings[]` with full attribution. Pass the consolidated findings directly to the Product Manager — do NOT invoke the `findings-consolidator` again (it would be redundant). The PM receives a single consolidated findings list with attribution from all native and external reviewers, so PM's decision-and-revision flow is unchanged — it simply processes fewer, better-attributed findings.

**Native-only path:** Before the Product Manager reads the raw reviewer outputs, invoke the **findings-consolidator** sub-agent (Haiku-backed) with all reviewer outputs from Step 6a. The consolidator:

- Deduplicates findings that multiple reviewers raised about the same issue
- Groups findings by plan section
- Sorts by severity
- Preserves attribution (so PM knows which reviewer raised each finding)
- Flags severity disagreements between reviewers

Pass the consolidated findings list to the Product Manager instead of the raw reviewer outputs. This reduces PM's reading load substantially (typically 3-5x fewer tokens) without losing any information. If the consolidator flags a finding as a "potential duplicate" rather than merging, the PM resolves the ambiguity.

**Step 6d: Product Manager Addresses Feedback**

The Product Manager receives the consolidated findings (from the orchestrator envelope on the multi-model path, or from the findings-consolidator on the native-only path) and:
1. **Must address** all CRITICAL and HIGH findings (per `review_loops.min_severity_to_address` config)
2. **May address** MEDIUM and LOW findings at its discretion
3. **Has final say** on requirements content — if a reviewer suggests changing *what* to build, the PM decides. But feedback on *clarity* (is this task clear enough to execute?) carries high weight.
4. **Asks the user** for guidance when unsure how to handle feedback — especially architectural trade-offs, scope questions, or conflicting reviewer opinions
5. Documents how each CRITICAL/HIGH finding was addressed (accepted, modified, or rejected with reasoning)

**PM's decision-and-revision flow is UNCHANGED by multi-model.** The `plan-scribe` still applies edits to the plan document. Multi-model only changes who contributes findings and how they are consolidated before the PM receives them — downstream PM behavior is identical whether the findings arrived from the orchestrator or from the native-only findings-consolidator.

**Step 6e: Re-review if Needed**

If the PM made significant changes, submit the revised plan for another review cycle by returning to Step 6a (spawning fresh reviewer sub-agents). Continue until:
- All CRITICAL and HIGH findings are addressed, OR
- `review_loops.max_cycles` is reached (default: 3 for implementation plans)

If max cycles are reached with unresolved findings, document them in the Open Questions section.

### 7. Compactness Review

After the peer review loop completes, the Product Manager does a final compactness pass:
- Remove redundant or duplicated information
- Tighten language — say more with fewer words
- Ensure no information is lost in the process
- The plan will be loaded into agent context windows, so every unnecessary line costs capacity

**Rule of thumb:** If a section can be 30% shorter without losing meaning, make it shorter.

### 8. Write the Plan

Write the finalized implementation plan to `@{plan_path}`.

### 9. Update Project Files

- Update `@CLAUDE.md` with any relevant workflow patterns, commands, or conventions discovered during planning
- Do NOT place the plan itself in CLAUDE.md

---

## Output

The implementation plan will follow this structure:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Product Name]

## Overview
[Brief summary linking back to the PRD. Keep this to 2-3 sentences.]

## Decisions

Major decisions made during planning that influence task structure. Ensures consistency as the plan evolves.

| # | Decision | Context | Rationale |
|---|----------|---------|-----------|
| D1 | [What was decided] | [Why this came up] | [Why we chose this path] |

## Open Questions

Items requiring further discovery that could lead to future decisions and plan changes.

| # | Question | Impact | Status |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| Q1 | [What we need to figure out] | [What it could affect in the plan] | Open |

## Phase 1: [Name — Delivers X Value]

### Milestone 1.1: [Name]
| # | Task | Complexity | Dependencies | Status |
|---|------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | [Task description] | S/M/L | None | pending |
| 2 | [Task description] | M | Task 1 | pending |
| 3 | [Task description] | S | None | pending |

**Task 1 Acceptance Criteria:**
- `[T]` [Testable criterion — specific, verifiable by automated test]
- `[T]` [Another testable criterion]
- `[H]` [Human-validated criterion — requires user approval before merge]

**Task 2 Acceptance Criteria:**
- `[T]` [Testable criterion]

**Task 3 Acceptance Criteria:**
- `[T]` [Testable criterion]
- `[T]` [Another testable criterion]

**Parallelizable:** Tasks 1 and 3 can run concurrently. Task 1 has `[H]` criteria — start it first so user review can overlap with Task 3 execution. _(max @{concurrent_tasks} concurrent per config)_
**Milestone Value:** [What the user gets when this milestone is complete]
**Observational Outcomes:** `[O]` [Outcomes measurable only after deployment — e.g., adoption rates, error reduction. Tracked at milestone/phase level, not task level.]

### Milestone 1.2: [Name]
...

## Phase 2: [Name — Delivers Y Value]
...
```

---

## Project Configuration

The `write-implementation-plan` command reads its configuration from `.synthex/config.yaml` in the project root. This is part of the Synthex's project configuration framework — a standard mechanism for projects to customize agent behavior.

### Configuration Schema

```yaml
# .synthex/config.yaml
#
# Project-level configuration for the Synthex plugin.
# When this file is absent, defaults are used.
# Only include sections you want to override — unspecified values use defaults.

# Global review loop defaults (apply to all commands with review loops)
review_loops:
  max_cycles: 2
  min_severity_to_address: high

implementation_plan:
  # Sub-agents that review the draft implementation plan
  # Each reviewer provides structured feedback that the Product Manager addresses
  reviewers:
    - agent: architect          # Sub-agent to invoke
      enabled: true             # Set to false to skip this reviewer
      focus: "..."              # What this reviewer should focus on

  # Per-command override: higher max_cycles for high-stakes plans
  review_loops:
    max_cycles: 3
```

### Adding a Custom Reviewer

To add a project-specific reviewer (e.g., a security reviewer for a fintech project):

```yaml
implementation_plan:
  reviewers:
    - agent: architect
      enabled: true
      focus: "Technical architecture, feasibility, NFR coverage"
    - agent: designer
      enabled: true
      focus: "Design tasks, UX impact, visual design clarity"
    - agent: tech-lead
      enabled: true
      focus: "Task clarity, acceptance criteria, parallelizability"
    - agent: security-reviewer
      enabled: true
      focus: "Security tasks, compliance requirements, threat modeling coverage"
```

### Disabling a Default Reviewer

To skip the designer reviewer for a backend-only project:

```yaml
implementation_plan:
  reviewers:
    - agent: architect
      enabled: true
      focus: "Technical architecture, feasibility, NFR coverage"
    - agent: designer
      enabled: false
    - agent: tech-lead
      enabled: true
      focus: "Task clarity, acceptance criteria, parallelizability"
```

---

## Native Looping

This command supports the native Synthex looping primitive (introduced by `docs/plans/native-looping.md`). Pass `--loop` to iterate until the completion promise is emitted or `--max-iterations` is reached. The mechanical iteration framework — state file schema, loop-id rules, shared-context vs. fresh-subagent iteration, auto-compaction guarantees, promise emission, iteration markers — lives once in [`plugins/synthex/docs/native-looping.md`](../docs/native-looping.md). Only the command-specific bits are inlined below.

### Emission Point

Emit `<promise>{completion_promise}</promise>` (literal text from `--completion-promise`) in the iteration's final response when ALL of the following hold:

- The implementation plan file has been written to disk.
- Every PRD requirement is reflected in at least one task in the plan.
- The plan contains no `TBD`, `<placeholder>`, `???`, or open-question markers in task descriptions or acceptance criteria.
- A follow-up iteration would not add new tasks or refine existing ones (the agent's judgment — typically when reviewers' suggested edits have been incorporated and no further drafts are pending).

Do NOT emit the promise while the plan still contains unresolved questions or TBD markers, or while a review-loop cycle is in flight. Subsequent iterations should consolidate review feedback into the plan; the loop terminates when the plan stabilizes.

### Iteration Body

When `--loop` is set, this command's existing workflow runs once per iteration. The agent follows the iteration loop body documented at [`shared-iter`](../docs/native-looping.md#shared-iter) by default (D-NL1 shared-context), or [`subagent-iter`](../docs/native-looping.md#subagent-iter) when `--loop-isolated` is passed: boundary check → increment counter → print marker → execute workflow → scan for promise → cancellation check → loop. State lives in `.synthex/loops/<loop-id>.json` per [FR-NL8](../docs/native-looping.md#state). Auto-compaction is safe because iteration state and work output both live on disk (FR-NL16, FR-NL17, FR-NL24).

The iteration marker (`[loop <loop-id> iteration <N>/<max>]`) prints to stdout before each iteration's workflow runs. See [`markers`](../docs/native-looping.md#markers).

## Critical Requirements

- Every task must trace back to a requirement in the PRD
- Prioritize developer infrastructure and tooling in early milestones (unblocks everything else)
- Each milestone must produce a working, demonstrable increment
- Parallelizable tasks must be explicitly identified
- Dependencies must be accurate — a task should never depend on something in a later phase/milestone
- Complexity grades (S/M/L) should be realistic and consistent
- The Decisions section must capture all major planning decisions with rationale
- The Open Questions section must track all unresolved items
- The final plan must be as compact as possible without losing information
- The Product Manager must address all CRITICAL and HIGH reviewer findings
- The Product Manager may ask the user for help when unsure about feedback
- Every task must have typed acceptance criteria — each criterion tagged `[T]`, `[H]`, or `[O]`
- Every task that produces functional behavior must have at least one `[T]` criterion
- `[O]` criteria must live at the milestone or phase level, not individual tasks
- Tasks with `[H]` criteria must be flagged in the parallelization notes so execution commands can schedule user reviews efficiently
