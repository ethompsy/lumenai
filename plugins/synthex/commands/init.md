# Initialize Synthex

Set up the Synthex plugin configuration for a project. This command scaffolds the configuration file and document directories needed for the plugin to operate.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `config_path` | Where to create the config file | `.synthex/config.yaml` | No |

## What This Command Does

1. **Creates the project configuration file** at `.synthex/config.yaml` (or custom path)
2. **Prompts for concurrent task parallelism** — detects CPU count and asks the user to choose a concurrency level (Yolo, Aggressive, Default, or custom)
3. **Configures multi-model review (optional)** — scans for installed CLIs, runs auth checks, and offers opt-in options for multi-model review
4. **Configures the Notion backend (optional)** — offers to route documents and implementation-plan tasks into an existing Notion workspace
5. **Updates `.gitignore`** to exclude the worktrees directory (`.claude/worktrees/`) if not already present
6. **Creates `.worktreeinclude`** so Claude Code copies env files (e.g., `.env`, `.env.local`) into every new worktree
7. **Asks about starring the repo** — offers to open the Lumenai marketplace on GitHub so the user can star it
8. **Creates document directories** (`docs/reqs/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/specs/decisions/`, `docs/specs/rfcs/`, `docs/runbooks/`, `docs/retros/`) if they don't exist
9. **Provides guidance** on customizing the configuration for your project

## Workflow

### 1. Check for Existing Configuration

Check if `@{config_path}` already exists.

- **If it exists:** Inform the user that a configuration already exists. Ask if they want to review it, reset it to defaults, or leave it as-is.
- **If it doesn't exist:** Proceed to create it.

### 2. Create Configuration File

Read the default configuration template from the plugin's `config/defaults.yaml` file (located relative to this command at `../config/defaults.yaml`) using the **Read** tool. Then create the directory `.synthex/` in the project root if it doesn't exist, and write the template content to `@{config_path}` using the **Write** tool.

**Implementation rules — strict:**

- Use the **Read** tool to load `defaults.yaml`. Use the **Write** tool to create the project config. **Do NOT use `cp`, `cat >`, `sed -i`, `tee`, or any shell command that takes the defaults path as an argument.** Shell commands trigger Claude Code's sensitive-file permission prompt (which flags both source and destination of `cp`) and risk argument-order bugs that could overwrite the plugin's defaults.
- The plugin's `defaults.yaml` is **read-only**. Never write to it, never pass it as a destination argument to any tool, never edit it. It is a template, not project state.
- The destination `@{config_path}` (default `.synthex/config.yaml`) is the only file this step creates.

### 3. Configure Concurrent Tasks

Prompt the user to choose how many parallel tasks Synthex should run. This value controls `implementation_plan.concurrent_tasks` and `next_priority.concurrent_tasks` in the config file.

#### 3a. Detect CPU Count

Detect the number of logical CPUs on the machine using the appropriate system command:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS | `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` |
| Linux | `nproc` |
| Windows (PowerShell) | `$env:NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` |

**Fallback:** If CPU detection fails for any reason, default to `12`.

Store the detected CPU count as `cpus`.

#### 3b. Calculate Options

Compute the following preset values:

| Option | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Yolo | `cpus` | Use all available CPUs — maximum parallelism |
| Aggressive | `max(floor(cpus * 0.75), 8)` | High parallelism with headroom for system processes. If CPU detection failed, use `8`. |
| Default | `3` | Conservative — works well on any machine |

#### 3c. Ask the User

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present the options. The question should be formatted as:

> **How many parallel tasks should Synthex run?**
>
> This controls how many tasks execute concurrently during planning and execution (e.g., `next-priority`, `write-implementation-plan`). Higher values speed up work but use more system resources.
>
> 1. **Yolo ({cpus})** — All CPUs, maximum parallelism
> 2. **Aggressive ({aggressive_value})** — 75% of CPUs, leaves headroom
> 3. **Default (3)** — Conservative, works on any machine
>
> Or type a custom number.

Where `{cpus}` and `{aggressive_value}` are the computed values from step 3b.

#### 3d. Validate the Response

The response **must** resolve to a positive integer. Apply these rules:

1. If the user picks an option by number (e.g., "1", "2", "3") or name (e.g., "yolo", "aggressive", "default"), resolve it to the corresponding integer value.
2. If the user types a plain integer (e.g., "6"), use that value directly.
3. If the response is NOT a valid positive integer and cannot be resolved to one, re-ask using `AskUserQuestion`:

   > That doesn't look like a valid number. `concurrent_tasks` must be a positive integer (e.g., 3, 8, 16). Please enter a number or pick one of the options above.

4. Repeat validation until a valid positive integer is obtained. Do NOT proceed until you have a valid integer.

#### 3e. Update the Config File

Replace **both** `concurrent_tasks` values in the config file at `@{config_path}`:
- `implementation_plan.concurrent_tasks` — set to the chosen value
- `next_priority.concurrent_tasks` — set to the chosen value

### 4. Configure Multi-Model Review (optional)

Delegate to the `/synthex:configure-multi-model` wizard at `plugins/synthex/commands/configure-multi-model.md`. Read that file and follow Steps 1a–1d (Detection Scan, Surface Three Options, Data-Transmission Warning, Apply the Chosen Option) inline as part of `init`. Skip Step 0 (re-entry check) — `init` always invokes the wizard in fresh-configuration mode.

### 5. Configure Notion Backend (optional)

Delegate to the `/synthex:configure-notion` wizard at `plugins/synthex/commands/configure-notion.md`. Read that file and follow Steps 1–8 (MCP Availability Check through Confirm) inline as part of `init`. Skip Step 0 (re-entry check) — `init` always invokes the wizard in fresh-configuration mode.

The wizard exits cleanly on its own when the Notion MCP server is unavailable, which is the common case. That is not an error for the project: Synthex keeps using local markdown files. **A skipped or unavailable Notion setup must never abort `init`.**

### 6. Update .gitignore

Check if `.gitignore` exists in the project root. Ensure it contains entries for **three** synthex-managed paths:

1. The worktrees base path (`.claude/worktrees` by default, or the value from `worktrees.base_path` in the config file).
2. The synthex upgrade-nudge state file (`.synthex/state.json`) — per FR-UO24, this file is per-developer/per-clone and must not be committed.
3. The synthex native-looping state directory (`.synthex/loops/`) — per FR-NL10 / D-NL14, loop state is per-developer/per-clone (each loop is per-session and includes a `session_id`).

For each entry:

- **If `.gitignore` exists and does NOT contain the path:** Append it.
- **If `.gitignore` exists and already contains the path:** Do nothing for that entry.
- **If `.gitignore` does not exist:** Create it.

Concretely, the resulting block to append (omitting any lines already present) is:

```
# Synthex worktrees (parallel task execution)
.claude/worktrees/

# Synthex per-developer state (upgrade-nudge tracking)
.synthex/state.json

# Synthex native-looping state (per-session, per-developer)
.synthex/loops/
```

### 7. Create `.worktreeinclude`

Claude Code's built-in worktree support (`claude --worktree`, subagent `isolation: worktree`) creates a fresh checkout that does NOT include gitignored files like `.env`. A `.worktreeinclude` file at the project root tells Claude Code which gitignored files to copy into each new worktree, using `.gitignore` syntax. Only files that both match a pattern AND are gitignored get copied — tracked files are never duplicated.

Check if `.worktreeinclude` exists in the project root.

- **If it does NOT exist:** Use the **Write** tool to create it with the following starter content:

  ```
  # Files copied into every Claude Code worktree (--worktree, subagent isolation, desktop parallel sessions).
  # Syntax matches .gitignore. Only files that both match here AND are gitignored are copied.
  # Add anything a fresh checkout needs: env files, local credentials, generated config not in source control.

  .env
  .env.local
  ```

- **If it already exists:** Do not overwrite or modify it. Inform the user briefly: ".worktreeinclude already exists — left unchanged."

The file is committed to the repo so the whole team benefits from the same worktree-population behavior. Mention this in the confirmation step (Step 10).

### 8. Ask About Starring the Repo

After the configuration scaffolding is in place, ask the user whether they'd like to star the Lumenai marketplace repository on GitHub. Stars help more developers find the project — which means more eyeballs for new features and bug fixes.

Delegate to the `/synthex:star` command at `plugins/synthex/commands/star.md`. Read that file and follow Steps 2 and 3 (Ask the user → Apply the user's choice) inline as part of `init`. Skip Step 1 (the state-existence check) — `init` has already ensured `.synthex/` exists. If the user picks "Maybe later", do nothing extra; the upgrade-nudge hook will surface the prompt again on the next version bump.

### 9. Create Document Directories

Create the following directories if they don't already exist:
- `docs/reqs/` — Product requirements documents
- `docs/plans/` — Implementation plans
- `docs/specs/` — Technical specifications
- `docs/specs/decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- `docs/specs/rfcs/` — Requests for Comments (RFCs)
- `docs/runbooks/` — Operational runbooks
- `docs/retros/` — Retrospective documents

Do NOT create any files inside these directories — just the directories.

### 10. Confirm and Guide

Inform the user what was created and provide guidance:

```
Synthex initialized for this project.

Created:
  .synthex/config.yaml           — Project configuration (concurrent_tasks: {chosen_value})
  .gitignore                     — Added worktrees path (if not present)
  .worktreeinclude               — Env files copied into new Claude Code worktrees (if not present)
  docs/reqs/                     — Product requirements (PRDs)
  docs/plans/                    — Implementation plans
  docs/specs/                    — Technical specifications
  docs/specs/decisions/          — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  docs/specs/rfcs/               — Requests for Comments (RFCs)
  docs/runbooks/                 — Operational runbooks
  docs/retros/                   — Retrospective documents
  docs/reviews/                  — Multi-model review audit artifacts (if multi-model enabled)

Next steps:
  1. Review .synthex/config.yaml and customize for your project
  2. Create your PRD with the `write-implementation-plan` command
  3. Or write your PRD manually at docs/reqs/main.md

Available commands:
  /write-implementation-plan   — Transform a PRD into an implementation plan
  /next-priority               — Execute the next highest-priority tasks
  /review-code                 — Multi-perspective code review
  /write-adr                   — Create an Architecture Decision Record
  /write-rfc                   — Create a Request for Comments
  /test-coverage-analysis      — Analyze test gaps, optionally write tests
  /design-system-audit         — Audit frontend for design system compliance
  /retrospective               — Facilitate a structured retrospective
  /reliability-review          — Assess operational readiness
  /performance-audit           — Full-stack performance analysis

Configuration guide:
  - Add reviewers:    Add entries to implementation_plan.reviewers
  - Remove reviewers: Set enabled: false on any default reviewer
  - Adjust rigor:     Change review_loops.max_cycles or review_loops.min_severity_to_address
  - Full reference:   See .synthex/config.yaml for all settings
```

## Configuration Overview

The configuration file controls how the Synthex plugin behaves in this project. Key settings:

### Implementation Plan Reviewers

By default, three sub-agents review every draft implementation plan:

| Reviewer | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| **Architect** | Technical architecture, feasibility, NFR coverage, missing technical tasks |
| **Designer** | Design tasks, UX impact, visual/interaction design clarity |
| **Tech Lead** | Task clarity, acceptance criteria, parallelizability, dependency accuracy |

**Adding a reviewer** (e.g., for a security-sensitive project):

```yaml
implementation_plan:
  reviewers:
    - agent: architect
      enabled: true
      focus: "Technical architecture, feasibility, NFR coverage"
    - agent: designer
      enabled: true
      focus: "Design tasks, UX impact, visual design clarity"
    - agent: tech-lead
      enabled: true
      focus: "Task clarity, acceptance criteria, parallelizability"
    - agent: security-reviewer
      enabled: true
      focus: "Security requirements, threat modeling coverage, compliance tasks"
```

**Disabling a reviewer** (e.g., for a backend-only project with no design needs):

```yaml
implementation_plan:
  reviewers:
    - agent: designer
      enabled: false
```

### Review Rigor

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `review_loops.max_cycles` | 2 | Global max review loop iterations (all commands) |
| `review_loops.min_severity_to_address` | high | Global minimum severity that must be resolved |
| `implementation_plan.review_loops.max_cycles` | 3 | Per-command override for implementation plans |

### Document Paths

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `documents.requirements` | `docs/reqs/main.md` | Default PRD location |
| `documents.implementation_plan` | `docs/plans/main.md` | Default plan location |
| `documents.specs` | `docs/specs` | Technical specs directory |
| `documents.decisions` | `docs/specs/decisions` | Architecture Decision Records |
| `documents.rfcs` | `docs/specs/rfcs` | Requests for Comments |
| `documents.runbooks` | `docs/runbooks` | Operational runbooks |
| `documents.retros` | `docs/retros` | Retrospective documents |

## Design Philosophy

The Synthex uses a **convention over configuration** approach:

- **Without a config file:** All commands and agents use sensible embedded defaults. Everything works out of the box.
- **With a config file:** Projects can override specific settings. Only include what you want to change — unspecified values use defaults.
- **Config lives in the repo:** `.synthex/config.yaml` is a project file, version-controlled alongside code, so the team shares the same configuration.
