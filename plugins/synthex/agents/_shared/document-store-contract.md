# Document Store Contract

> The normative contract every document backend implements. Commands resolve documents and task state through these operations instead of naming filesystem paths directly, so the filesystem-vs-Notion branch exists in exactly one place rather than in every document-centric command.

## Status: Normative

## Source authority

- FR-NB1 (backend resolution order)
- FR-NB4 (epic scoping — the multi-team safety guarantee)
- FR-NB5 (property mapping and graceful degradation)
- FR-NB7 (task identity)
- FR-NB9 (error enum and fail-soft degradation)
- Cross-reference: [`canonical-finding-schema.md`](./canonical-finding-schema.md) — the sibling normative schema this document's structure follows

---

## 1. Backends

Two backends implement this contract:

| Backend | Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| `filesystem` | Inline Read / Write / Edit tool calls against a resolved path. **This is today's behavior, unchanged.** | Default |
| `notion` | The `notion-document-store` and `notion-task-store` adapter agents, via Notion MCP tools | Opt-in |

**Resolution order for a given document type** — first match wins:

1. `documents.backend_overrides.<doc_type>`
2. `documents.backend`
3. `filesystem` (hardcoded default)

This mirrors the established `review_loops` resolution idiom (per-command → global → hardcoded).

### Regression contract (FR-NB2)

When `notion.enabled: false`, every operation MUST route to the `filesystem` backend and behave **byte-identically** to the pre-contract implementation. `documents.backend: notion` without `notion.enabled: true` is a configuration error, not a silent opt-in.

Baselines for verifying this live in `tests/__snapshots__/notion-backend/baseline/`.

---

## 2. Document operations

Document types are the keys of the `documents` config block: `requirements`, `implementation_plan`, `specs`, `decisions`, `rfcs`, `runbooks`, `retros`.

| Operation | Input | Output |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `resolve` | `doc_type`, optional explicit `ref` | `handle` |
| `read` | `handle` | `{ content_markdown, version }` |
| `write` | `handle`, `content_markdown` | `{ version }` |
| `patch` | `handle`, `edits[]` | `{ version }` |
| `create` | `doc_type`, `title`, `content_markdown` | `handle` |
| `list` | `doc_type` | `handle[]` |

### Handles

A `handle` is opaque. Callers MUST NOT parse it or construct one by hand.

- `filesystem` backend: a repo-relative path (`docs/plans/main.md`)
- `notion` backend: a page ID

### Document scope: epic-scoped vs cross-cutting

Document types divide along a line that predates this feature: some belong to a single initiative, others outlive every initiative.

| Scope | Document types | Anchored to |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Epic-scoped** | `brief`, `requirements`, `implementation_plan`, `retros` | the epic's own page |
| **Cross-cutting** | `specs`, `decisions`, `rfcs`, `runbooks` | `notion.docs_root`, or the filesystem |

In Notion every row of a database is itself a page and can contain subpages, so when the epic is a row in an epics database, that row is the natural anchor for the initiative's documents. Its PRD, plan, and retrospectives become subpages of it, and its work items relate to it — one entry point for everything about that initiative, with nothing for a reader to navigate between.

Cross-cutting documents have no such anchor and resolve against `notion.docs_root`. They default to the `filesystem` backend, because Synthex itself reads them on every review invocation and they are engineering-internal.

### The brief is the epic's own body

`brief` is epic-scoped like the others, but it resolves to the epic page **itself** rather than to a subpage of it. The brief answers *why are we doing this, for whom, and how will we know it worked* — which is precisely what an epic row is for, and where stakeholders already look.

This has three consequences.

**It is a `patch` target, never a `write` target.** An epic body belongs to the team and commonly holds content Synthex did not author. A full-document `write` would discard it. Every brief update MUST be section-scoped, so body content outside the brief's own sections survives untouched.

**An existing body is input, not an obstacle.** When the body is populated, it is read as a source and refined into the standard brief format collaboratively — not replaced, and not left inconsistent. Content that maps to no standard section MUST be surfaced to the user or preserved under `Additional context`; it MUST NOT be dropped. Reshaping prose into a template is exactly where material quietly disappears, and silently deleting a PM's framing is not a recoverable error.

**It has no conventional title**, because it is not a child page. Resolution for `brief` is the resolved epic page, full stop — `notion.targets.brief` is meaningless and MUST be ignored if present.

Under the `filesystem` backend the brief is an ordinary document at `documents.brief`, and all of the above except the title rule applies unchanged.

### Target resolution

`resolve` locates a document type's page in this order, first match wins:

1. An explicit `ref` supplied by the caller
2. `notion.targets.<doc_type>` — resolved page IDs that `configure-notion` writes as it nominates or creates each target. Deterministic, and survives the page being renamed.
3. **Epic-scoped types:** a subpage of the resolved epic page whose title matches the type's conventional name
4. **Cross-cutting types:** a child of `notion.docs_root` whose title matches

Conventional subpage titles for epic-scoped types:

| Document type | Title |
|---------------|-------|
| `requirements` | `Product Requirements` |
| `implementation_plan` | `Implementation Plan` |
| `retros` | `Retrospective <YYYY-MM-DD>` — dated, since retrospectives accumulate; `list` returns them newest first |
| `brief` | *(none — resolves to the epic page itself, not a subpage)* |

Steps 3 and 4 MUST fail with `target_not_found` rather than choose when more than one candidate matches. Silently reading the wrong PRD is worse than failing.

An epic-scoped `resolve` requires a resolved epic (§4). Without one it fails `schema_mismatch` — there is no anchor to resolve against, and falling back to `docs_root` would silently mix one initiative's documents into another's.

### `version`

An opaque backend-supplied marker used for conflict detection. `filesystem` may return `null`. The `notion` backend returns the page's `last_edited_time`. A `write` or `patch` whose supplied `version` no longer matches MUST fail with `conflict` rather than overwrite.

### `patch` semantics

`edits[]` entries are `{ old_str, new_str }` pairs applied to named sections. `patch` is **section-scoped**: content outside the targeted sections MUST survive untouched. This is what allows a human editing one part of a Notion page to coexist with Synthex writing another — a routine occurrence, not an exceptional one.

Prefer `patch` over `write` whenever the change is localized. `write` replaces the whole document and will discard concurrent human edits.

---

## 3. Task operations

| Operation | Input | Output |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `list_tasks` | `plan_handle`, optional `filter` | `task[]` |
| `update_task_status` | `task_ref`, `status`, optional `notes` | `{ version }` |
| `annotate_task` | `task_ref`, `annotations` | `{ version }` |

### Canonical task shape

```json
{
  "task_ref": "<opaque backend identifier>",
  "ordinal": 3,
  "title": "Add CSRF validation to login handler",
  "status": "pending",
  "complexity": "M",
  "milestone": "1.2",
  "dependencies": ["<task_ref>"],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    { "type": "T", "text": "...", "evidence": null },
    { "type": "H", "text": "...", "approved": false },
    { "type": "O", "text": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### Canonical status enum

`pending` → `in_progress` → `done`, plus off-path `blocked`.

These are the canonical values used in code and prose. The `notion` backend maps them onto the workspace's own option names via `notion.status_values` (see §5), because teams have their own vocabulary — `pending` may be `"Backlog"` and `done` may be `"Shipped"`.

### Task identity (FR-NB7)

`task_ref` is **opaque and stable for the life of the task**.

- `filesystem`: `<milestone>.<ordinal>`, preserving today's exact semantics
- `notion`: the row's Notion page ID

`ordinal` is **display-only**. `plan-scribe` renumbers ordinals whenever tasks are inserted or removed (`plan-scribe.md`), and implementations MUST NOT treat a renumber as re-identifying a task. Wiring ordinals to identity would silently rewire the dependency graph on every insert.

---

## 4. Epic scoping (FR-NB4)

**Normative and non-negotiable.** Synthex writes into databases that already hold other teams' work, so its reads and writes MUST be scoped.

For the `notion` backend:

1. Every task row Synthex creates MUST be stamped with the configured epic value.
2. Every `list_tasks` query MUST filter on the epic property.
3. Every `update_task_status` and `annotate_task` MUST verify the target row carries the configured epic value before writing, and fail with `permission_denied` if it does not.

A backend that cannot scope its queries MUST refuse to operate against a shared database. Falling back to an unscoped query is **never** an acceptable degradation — it risks reading and mutating tickets that do not belong to Synthex.

For the `filesystem` backend, epic scoping is a no-op: the plan file contains only this project's tasks.

### The property is workspace-wide; the value is per-plan

The epic **property** is a fact about the target database's schema, so it is configured once in `notion.epic.property`.

The epic **value** identifies one initiative, and a repository commonly has several in flight at once — Synthex already supports this on the filesystem, where each initiative is its own plan document (`docs/plans/<initiative>.md`). A single configured value would make every initiative's rows indistinguishable, so `list_tasks` for one epic would return another epic's work and the plan-complete check would never fire until both finished.

The value is therefore carried by the plan itself. Every implementation plan records its own epic on a `**Epic:**` line immediately beneath its H1:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Billing Migration

**Epic:** Billing Migration
```

Resolution order for the value, first match wins:

1. The plan document's `**Epic:**` line — **authoritative**
2. `notion.epic.value` — a default for plans that do not declare one
3. Neither → `schema_mismatch`; refuse to operate on tasks

Binding the value to the plan is what makes targeting the wrong initiative structurally impossible rather than merely discouraged: a command cannot query or write task rows without having read the plan those rows belong to, and the plan names its own epic. There is no flag to forget and no config entry to fall out of sync.

**Callers resolve the value; adapters do not.** A command already reads the plan, so it extracts the value and passes it in the `epic` config it hands the task store. The task store never reads plan documents — it validates that both `property` and `value` are present and refuses otherwise (§4, rule 1). The adapter's input contract is unchanged by this.

Under the `filesystem` backend the line is still written, and is inert. Keeping both backends' plan documents identical in shape means a plan can move between them without rewriting, and a plan authored locally already carries what the Notion backend will need.

### Resolving the epic reference

The value must resolve to whatever the scoping property can actually be filtered on, and that depends on the property's type.

| Property type | Filter value must be | So the plan's value is |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| `relation` | a page **UUID** | a link or URL carrying the epic page's id |
| `select`, `multi_select`, `status`, text | the option or string itself | the plain name |

**Notion cannot filter a relation by page name.** A plan naming its epic as bare text against a relation property filters on nothing and returns an empty result set — which is indistinguishable from "this initiative has no work left." That failure is silent and wrong in the most damaging direction, so it MUST be prevented rather than tolerated.

Accordingly, when the scoping property is a `relation`, resolve the plan's value in this order:

1. A markdown link — `[Billing Migration](https://www.notion.so/<id>)` — take the id from the URL. **Preferred**: one line carrying a label for people and an id for the filter.
2. A bare Notion URL, or a bare UUID — take the id directly.
3. A plain name — perform exactly **one** title lookup against `notion.epics_database`. Accept only a unique exact match. Zero matches or more than one MUST fail `schema_mismatch` naming the ambiguity.

Step 3 exists so plans written before the link convention still work. It is a convenience, not a fallback to guessing: an ambiguous name fails rather than picking a candidate.

A resolved reference MUST NOT be invented from a filename, branch, page title, or any other incidental string (§4 applies).

### Assignee scoping

A shared work database usually carries work for many engineers within the same initiative, so epic scoping alone can still collide: two engineers running Synthex against one epic could select the same item.

When `notion.assignee.property` is configured, task queries MUST additionally scope to work the invoking engineer may legitimately take:

> assigned to **me**, **or** unassigned

Unassigned items are claimable; items assigned to someone else are not. Expressed as a filter, this is the epic predicate ANDed with a nested `or` of `person_contains me` and `is_empty`.

Two behaviors make the claim real rather than advisory:

- **`create_tasks` leaves new items unassigned.** A planned task is available work, not work already owned.
- **`update_task_status` to `in_progress` claims the item** by setting the assignee to the current user, when the property is mapped and the item is currently unassigned. This is what closes the collision: once claimed, another engineer's query excludes it, because it is neither theirs nor unassigned.

Claiming is the only property beyond status that a status transition may write, and only under those two conditions. It is load-bearing — without it, "unassigned is claimable" lets two engineers claim the same item simultaneously.

The current user is resolved at runtime from the MCP, so no configuration identifies the engineer.

When `notion.assignee.property` is null, assignee scoping is skipped entirely and epic scoping alone applies. That is correct for an epic effectively owned by one engineer, and it is the documented cost of leaving it unset.

---

## 5. Property mapping and degradation (FR-NB5)

The `notion` backend targets a database that already exists, whose schema Synthex does not control. `notion.property_map` maps canonical fields onto that database's actual property names.

| Canonical field | Requirement | Behavior when unmapped |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| `title` | **Required** | Refuse to operate; `schema_mismatch` |
| `status` | **Required** | Refuse to operate; `schema_mismatch` |
| `epic` | **Required** (§4) | Refuse to operate; `schema_mismatch` |
| `complexity` | Optional | Recorded in the plan overview page |
| `milestone` | Optional | Recorded in the plan overview page |
| `dependencies` | Optional | Recorded in the plan overview page |
| `acceptance_criteria` | Optional | Recorded in the task page body |

Only the three required fields are load-bearing. Everything else degrades: the data still exists, it simply is not a queryable column.

**Synthex MUST NOT alter an existing database's schema** — not to add a property, not to add a select option, not to change a type — without explicit user consent obtained at configuration time. Silent schema migration of a live team database is the single most damaging thing this integration could do.

---

## 6. Error enum (FR-NB9)

When an operation fails it MUST return one of these values. Implementations MUST NOT introduce new ones; a new failure mode requires amending FR-NB9 and this contract.

| Value | Meaning | Retry |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `mcp_unavailable` | The Notion MCP server is not configured or not reachable | Terminal |
| `notion_auth_failed` | MCP reachable but not authorized for this workspace | Terminal |
| `target_not_found` | Configured page or database does not exist or is not shared with the integration | Terminal |
| `permission_denied` | Authorized but not permitted to read/write the target, or the row failed the epic check (§4) | Terminal |
| `schema_mismatch` | A required property mapping is absent or the wrong type | Terminal |
| `rate_limited` | Notion returned a rate-limit response | Retry once with backoff |
| `conflict` | The document changed since `version` was read | Re-read and re-apply |
| `unknown_error` | Catch-all | Terminal |

### Degradation policy

Default is **fail-soft**: on any error, fall back to the `filesystem` backend for that document type and emit a warning naming the `error_code` and the affected document type. Work proceeds against the local markdown file.

`notion.strict_mode: true` aborts instead of falling back. Intended for teams where a silent divergence between Notion and local state is worse than a failed command.

Two exceptions to fail-soft:

- **Epic-scoping failure (§4)** never degrades to an unscoped query.
- **`mcp_unavailable` across the board** emits a single remediation message rather than one warning per document type, mirroring the `NFR-MR2` cloud-surface pattern.

---

## 7. Response envelope

```json
{
  "status": "success | failed",
  "error_code": null,
  "error_message": null,
  "backend": "filesystem | notion",
  "operation": "read",
  "doc_type": "implementation_plan",
  "result": {},
  "degraded_from": null
}
```

- **error_code** — REQUIRED when `status: "failed"`, MUST be in the §6 enum. NULL on success.
- **backend** — the backend that actually served the operation, which may differ from the configured one after a fail-soft fallback.
- **degraded_from** — set to `"notion"` when the operation fell back to filesystem, else null. This is what makes a degraded run visible instead of silently indistinguishable from a healthy one.

---

## 8. Validation surface

Layer 1 validators MUST enforce:

- `status` ∈ {`success`, `failed`}
- `error_code` in the §6 enum when failed, null when successful
- `backend` ∈ {`filesystem`, `notion`}
- Canonical task `status` ∈ {`pending`, `in_progress`, `done`, `blocked`}
- Acceptance-criteria `type` ∈ {`T`, `H`, `O`}
- Every task query and write in the Notion adapters is epic-scoped (§4)
- Required property mappings present; optional ones degrade rather than fail (§5)

Implemented in `tests/schemas/document-store-envelope.ts`, `tests/schemas/notion-epic-scoping.test.ts`, and `tests/schemas/notion-property-mapping.test.ts`. This document is the source of truth for those validators.

## Used by

- `notion-document-store` — document operations (§2)
- `notion-task-store` — task operations (§3), epic scoping (§4), property mapping (§5)
- `configure-notion` — schema discovery and mapping setup (§5), consent for any schema change
- Commands resolving documents through the contract: `write-implementation-plan`, `refine-requirements`, `next-priority`, `write-adr`, `write-rfc`, `retrospective`, `reliability-review`
- `plan-scribe`, `plan-linter`, `product-manager` — canonical task model (§3)
