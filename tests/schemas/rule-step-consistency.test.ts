/**
 * Cross-checks each file's procedural steps against its own behavioral rules.
 *
 * Four bugs in the Notion backend shared one shape: a file stated a rule and
 * then contradicted it a few paragraphs later in a step. The most recent was
 * `use-epic.md`, whose rule 4 forbids deriving a recorded path from a label
 * while Step 5 did exactly that for Notion-routed documents. Every existing
 * assertion passed, because they check that a file *contains* the right
 * statements — never that its procedure honours them.
 *
 * Two mechanisms here.
 *
 * 1. Structural hygiene across every file that has a rules list.
 * 2. An anchored-rule registry: each "Never ..." rule names the step that must
 *    enforce it and the text proving it does. A **completeness guard** fails
 *    when a covered file grows a "Never" rule with no registry entry, so the
 *    obligation accretes with the rules rather than rotting.
 *
 * The registry is hand-curated on purpose. Detecting arbitrary semantic
 * contradiction needs a judgement these tests cannot make; naming the specific
 * contradiction you are guarding against is what actually catches regressions.
 *
 * Cost: $0 (no LLM calls — pure file assertions)
